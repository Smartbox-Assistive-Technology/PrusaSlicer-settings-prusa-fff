# Smartbox PrusaSlicer-settings-prusa-fff

This is a fork of the [Prusaslicer-settings-prusa-fff repo](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer-settings-prusa-fff), updated to include profiles for filaments used by Smartbox Assistive Technology.

[![Fetch Latest PrusaSlicer Config and Release](https://github.com/Smartbox-Assistive-Technology/PrusaSlicer-settings-prusa-fff/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Smartbox-Assistive-Technology/PrusaSlicer-settings-prusa-fff/actions/workflows/release.yml)


## How it works

The script adds all the `*.add.ini` and `*.rm.ini` files in the [Smartbox](Smartbox) folder to the latest version of the prusa3d/PrusaSlicer-settings-prusa-fff repo, and then creates a new release with the updated files.

## Filament Types

Current filaments:

- **Eryone PP-CF** - Polypropylene with carbon fiber reinforcement
- **eSUN ePLA-CF** - Enhanced PLA with carbon fiber
